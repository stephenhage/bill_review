# Legislation Proposals
An unprecedented amount of government spending has been proposed (and much has been passed) in response to COVID-19. One attribute of these bills that has gotten media attention is the sheer length of the proposals, sometimes in excess of 1,800 pages. 

Even a gifted reader would struggle consuming that much content in the short time from the proposal stage to an actual vote. This project exists as an attempt to programmatically "read" proposals and give readable plain-English translations for regular American citizens. 

We all appreciate government transparency. Allowing concerned citizens to express opinions to lawmakers about the contents will improve legislation. So let's help people to understand what's in the proposals.
